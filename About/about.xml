        - Improves storm fog and particle effects for terrain-walled rooms
        - Dims the sun during appropriate storms

        [b]Configuration:[/b]
        - Indoor Fog Buffer: Additional buffer for to prevent fog from creeping in
        - Adjustment Speed: How quickly fog changes adapt

    <ChangeLog>
        Version 1.1.2
        - Fixed bug causing error in coroutine
        - Stopped logging room updates
        - Added scaling for the update popup

        Version 1.1.1
        - Disabled storm particle changes (fog effect remains stays) in multiplayer until replication is resolved

        Version 1.1.0
        - Improved handling of terrain-walled rooms during storms. Now your closed-in/pressurized tunnels won't get storm particles
        - Overrides the storm fog effect now as well
        - Added sun dimming for storms (minus solar storm of course)

        Version 1.0.0:
        - Detect and adjust fog based on indoors or outdoors
        - Determines if a room is sealed or venting
        - Traverse and updates cache of nearby rooms to propogate effect
        - Compares internal vs external atmo for interpolation in sealed but not cleaned up rooms
        - Config options added
